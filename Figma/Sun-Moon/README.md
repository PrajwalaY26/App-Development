# Sun-Moon Toggle Bar Figma Design

Welcome to the folder of my Sun-Moon Toggle Bar Figma Design! 📁

## 🌐 Overview

This folder contains the Figma design files for our innovative Sun-Moon Toggle Bar. This toggle bar is a user interface element that allows users to switch between two themes - a light (Sun) theme and a dark (Moon) theme in an application. 🌞🌛

## 🎨 Design Details

The design showcases a smooth transition between the Sun and Moon states, providing a visually pleasing experience for the users. The Sun state represents the light theme, and the Moon state represents the dark theme. 🔄
