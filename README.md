# My App Development Journey

Hello and welcome to my app development journey! I'm currently in the design phase of my project, using Figma to create the user interface and experience.

## Current Progress

As of now, I have worked on several designs which lay the foundation of the application. Each design focuses on different aspects of the app, providing a comprehensive view of how the final product will look and function.

## Design Details

For detailed information about each design, please refer to the individual README files associated with each one. These files provide in-depth explanations about the thought process behind each design, the challenges faced during the creation process, and how these designs contribute to the overall application.

## Future Steps

Moving forward, I plan to continue refining these designs based on feedback and new ideas that come along the way. Once the design phase is complete, the next step will be to start the development phase where these designs will be brought to life.

## Feedback and Suggestions

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any ideas or notice any areas that could be improved, feel free to share your thoughts.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my app development journey. Stay tuned for more updates!
