# App Development Journey

Welcome to my App Development Journey! This repository contains all the design files and code related to the app I'm currently developing.

## Design Phase

The design phase of the app is being carried out using Figma. The designs are organized into different files for each feature of the app. Each design file has its own README which provides detailed information about the design.

## How to Use

To understand the progress of the app development:

1. Navigate to the `Figma` folder to see all the design files.
2. Open each design file and refer to its README for specific details about that design.

## Feedback

I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
